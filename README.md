# How do I use this?
You need to clone it and then run `npm install`, then configure your `auth.json` file.

You NEED to have the following metadata tags filled out properly for this to work:
`name`, `year`

There are probably better ways of doing this, and if you think you can do a better job, go ahead and make a pull request.

# Can I use this on Windows?
I highly, highly, highly doubt it. Be my guest to try, but I developed this for Linux.

# Can I use this with x music player?
No. This is for cmus only.

Unless you rewrite it to work for that music player.
