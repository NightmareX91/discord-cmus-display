# How do I use this?
You need to clone it and then run `npm install`, then configure your `auth.json` file.

# Can I use this on Windows?
I highly, highly, highly doubt it. Be my guest to try, but I developed this for Linux.

# Can I use this with x music player?
No.

Unless you rewrite it to work for that music player.
